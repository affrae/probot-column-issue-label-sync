# Probot Column Issue Label Sync

A GitHub App built with [probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that will update an issue's column in a defined project when a label from a defined list of label:column keypairs is added to the issue - and ensure that label is unique from that same defined list.

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```
